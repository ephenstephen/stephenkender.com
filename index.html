  <p> I started getting into photography around 13, and learned a lot by practicing
    on my old point and shoot. It wasn't until a few years later that I splurged
    on a real DSLR for better pictures, but by then I had forgotten quite a bit. My weapon
    of choice is a Nikon D5300 with a 18-55mm kit lens. <br><br>
    I like the zoom lenses for a lot of wildlife photography, but nothing beats a wide
    angle landscape in my opinion. While I'm not going to toss up all my work on this site
    (bandwith and what not), I'll post my favorites in hopes that people enjoy them!</p>

    <p> Okay, long story short I helped a friend fix up an old typewriter they had
      laying around because I thought it would be a fun way to spend a lazy afternoon.
      And then I fell in love. And then a week later I bought my own (and now I'm
      realizing that I way overpaid for it, but it's whatever). <br><br>
      Since then (around September 2015), I've been able to curb my enthusiasm
      to a mere 4 more typewriters collected. One of them I got for free and never
      really use, and another I got just to tear apart and put back together (didn't
      get to the second part cause I broke it). But these seriously are some fantastic
      machines at the crossroads between mechanical awesomeness and sleek design; if you
      have one around, definitely try and use it! The tactile typing is so cool and it's
      really fun to type on one. If it's taking up space in your place, definitely let
      me know and I'd be happy to take it off your hands:)</p>
