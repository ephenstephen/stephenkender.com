  <p> I started getting into photography around 13, and learned a lot by practicing
    on my old point and shoot. It wasn't until a few years later that I splurged
    on a real DSLR for better pictures, but by then I had forgotten quite a bit. My weapon
    of choice is a Nikon D5300 with a 18-55mm kit lens. <br><br>
    I like the zoom lenses for a lot of wildlife photography, but nothing beats a wide
    angle landscape in my opinion. While I'm not going to toss up all my work on this site
    (bandwith and what not), I'll post my favorites in hopes that people enjoy them!</p>

    <p> Graphic design was another hobby that I just kind of picked up, but it was much more
      recent. I started out wanting a poster for the New Horizons satellite and its big mission,
      and I couldn't find any that I liked online. Then I just decided to make my own, and while
      it wasn't anything crazy special it was something I made and enjoyed doing!
    <br><br>
      You're probably thinking to yourself, "Stephen, this website sucks. Why do you have
      a section for graphic design when you're not even that good?" And I agree, because that's
      what I'm thinking to myself as well.</p>

    <p> Okay, long story short I helped a friend fix up an old typewriter they had
      laying around because I thought it would be a fun way to spend a lazy afternoon.
      And then I fell in love. And then a week later I bought my own (and now I'm
      realizing that I way overpaid for it, but it's whatever). <br><br>
      Since then (around September 2015), I've been able to curb my enthusiasm
      to a mere 4 more typewriters collected. One of them I got for free and never
      really use, and another I got just to tear apart and put back together (didn't
      get to the second part cause I broke it). But these seriously are some fantastic
      machines at the crossroads between mechanical awesomeness and sleek design; if you
      have one around, definitely try and use it! The tactile typing is so cool and it's
      really fun to type on one. If it's taking up space in your place, definitely let
      me know and I'd be happy to take it off your hands:)</p>

  <p>I'm a plastics engineer out of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, which has
    a great program for plastics people. A great part of it is being able to utilize actual
    equipment and methods you'll use in industry, rather than just staying in class and
    learning the theory.<br><br>
    I really found my stride in design work, and I think I'd like to work in
    product design or design engineering, where you can take an idea and bring it to
    life (while still accounting for manufacturability, cost, etc.). Who knows where
    I'll be in 5 years, but it's great to know what you want to do and be!</p>
